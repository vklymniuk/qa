## Non-relational Databases

Scope:
** NoSQL DB types and use cases
*** CAP/PACELC implications on distributed databases

**
Which types of non-relational databses do you know?
Describe usecases for each type you mentioned earlier.
What are BASE transactions? What is the difference in comparison with ACID? 
(Note: This is pure theoretical question. Alternatively ask about eventual consistency, e.g. what it means, ask for some examples).

***
Describe the implication of the CAP (or PACELC) theorem on the database of your choice
Describe the internal architecture of database of your choice.
Describe how the databse of your choice handle writes.


Goal:
Evaluate if the candidate is able to use RDBMS effectively and in a safe manner

Scope:
* relational DB conepts
** SQL (DML, DDL, DCL), transactions, indexes
*** isolation levels, window functions


*
Can please write simple query on two tables (joing two tables)? 
Which types of JOINs do you know?
What is the difference between JOIN and UNION?
Note: Try to ask about areas os SQL where candidate had some experience. 
E.g If never worked with union, but maybe had experience with aggregation, sorting, etc.

**
What is data normalization and denormalization and pros and cons? 
(Note: In case its difficult for candidate to answer ask about any  optimization techniques the candidate knows). 

What is aggregation function? How to filter results returned by the aggregation function?
What is transaction? 

Describe ACID transaction properties. 
(Note: This is pure theoretical question. If candidate does not know this abbreviation shift question to practical case. 
E.g.  ask how to add record to one table and increment record count in another table considering it will be executed in highly concurrent environment)

What are indexes? 

***
What are use cases for RDBMS database? 
(Note: In case candidate is confused try to rephrase question, e.g. when RDBMS may not be a good choice)

Which transaction isolation levels do you know? Describe which problems they solve.
What is Window functions and their purpose?
Describe indexes usecases and pros/cons?
