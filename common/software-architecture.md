## Software Architecture Patterns

Layered architecture, Event-Driven architecture, Microkernel architecture, Space-Based architrecture

*** What is layered architecture and its usecases and properties 
(in terms of testability, easy of deployment, performance, scalability and easy of development)?

What is event-driven architecture and its usecases?

**** What is mediator topology (in the event-drive architecture)?

Analyze it in terms of testability, easy of deployment, performance, scalability and easy of development.

What is broker topology (in the event-drive architecture)? 

Analyze it in terms of testability, easy of deployment, performance, scalability and easy of development.

What is mikcrokernel architecture and its usecases and properties 
(in terms of testability, easy of deployment, performance, scalability and easy of development)?

What is space-based architecture and its usecases and properties 
(in terms of testability, easy of deployment, performance, scalability and easy of development)?

## Performance testing Load testing

Performance / Load / Stress testing

**** What is performance testing?

What are common best practices and pitfalls when doing performance tests?

What is Load Testing?

What is Stress Testing?

What problems Performance / Load / Stress testing trying to find & solve?

## Troubleshooting

New Relic, DataDog, AirBrake/Sentry or similar.

**** Which tools will you use (or suggest to use) to monitor production errors (trackebacks) both backend and frontend, in case if there are no centralized logging in place, and you need it ASAP?

Which tool will you use (or suggest to use) to monitor infrustructure, in case if you have limited time and need the result ASAP. 

Which tool will you suggest to use in case if you need to set up performance monitoring of your 
system for both backend and frontend.
